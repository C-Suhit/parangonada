... is a performance to score alignment visualization and correction tool.

## how?
It works in with csv files for score, performance, expressive features (dynamics, timing, and articulation), and alignment.
It's possible to generate this file structure from any kind of alignment encoding, we use:
* [PARTITURA](https://github.com/CPJKU/partitura/tree/master)
* [BASISMIXER](https://github.com/OFAI/basismixer)

to visualize files in the match file format

## planned updates:
* simple python API to generate alignment data files
* match file format reference
