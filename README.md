https://sildater.github.io/parangonada/

## how?
It works in with csv files for score, performance, expressive features (dynamics, timing, and articulation), and alignment.
It's possible to generate this file structure from any kind of alignment encoding, we use:
* [PARTITURA](https://github.com/CPJKU/partitura/tree/master)
* [BASISMIXER](https://github.com/OFAI/basismixer)

to visualize files in the match file format

## planned updates:
* simple python API to generate alignment data files
* match file format reference
* piano keyboard
* documented code
* cleaned DOM interface
* tutorial video
* more appealing color palette for notes
* fix alignment export
* better piano soundfont

done:
* pitch names toggle
* black staff lines
* clefs
* default option full piece!
* scroll option (update left and right)
